# First-Steps-With-Keras
This Repository will give fine introduction to keras including tuning the model. 

The required libraries will be
1) Numpy 
2) Keras
3) Sklearn

# Prerequisites
1) Basic understanding of Deep Learning.
2) Knowledge of Pyhton

# Selecting Between Different Deep Learning Platforms
  There are lots of deep learning platforms. In order to decide one of them is some times a tough task as suggested by Andrew Ng(The keys to look for selecting Deep Learning Platforms):--
    1) Ease of programming(Deployment + Development)
    2) Running Speed
    3) Open Sourcing With good Governance
-->One thing I must tell you if you are begineer then we need to think the ease of implementation.
-->And taking all these things in account we can go with Keras and tensorflow.
-->But as a begineer tensorflow has steep learning curve but for keras its easy as implementation and as keras build on the top of tensorflow thus maintained by Google in Some sense.
